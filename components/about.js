              I am a meticulous, driven , and creative thinker who has worked
              professionally in both team and independent settings for the last
              ten years. I am a recent General Assembly graduate from the
              Software Engineering Immersive program. This has given me the
              knowledge to be proficient in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am
              searching for long term employment in an environment where I can
              continue to strengthen my skill set as a software developer.
