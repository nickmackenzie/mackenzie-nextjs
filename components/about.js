        I am a meticulous, driven , and creative thinker who has worked
        professionally in both team and independent settings for the last ten
        years. I am a recent General Assembly graduate from the Software
        Engineering Immersive program. This has given me the knowledge to be
        proficient in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am searching for long term
        employment in an environment where I can continue to strengthen my skill
